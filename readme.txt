// the sut.c file in sub#1 folder contained only the c_exec(), sut_init(), sut_shutdown(), sut_yield(), sut_shutdown(), and sut_exit().
// the sub#1 folder can run test1.c, test2.c, test3.c perfectly, with results shown as images in the folder.

// the sut.c file in sub#2 folder contained i_exec(), sut_open(), sut_close(), sut_read(), and sut_write() functions that I attempted to write.
// however, these new functions may bring new errors that will affect c_exec as well.
// for example, when I run sut.c and test1/2/3.c in sub#2, I get a segmentation fault.

// as a result, please use sub#1 for evaluating my c_exec() part, and use sub#2 for evaluation my i_exec() part and comments (code quality).

// detailed commands to run the files are included in the sub#1/2 folders.

// thank you!
